              <p>Charlie is a senior at Buckingham Browne and Nichols High School. As Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the flagship Community Tutoring, Charlie heads day-to-day operations and develops ideas, objectives, and special projects while overseeing CTâ€™s Leadership Team and communicating with tutors and families. Charlie founded Community Tutoring to provide high-quality, free tutoring to communities worldwide, not just in Boston. Charlie took over the original branch called Boston Covid-Tutoring as Co-President in 2023. Leading the rebrand from Boston Covid-Tutoring to Boston Community Tutoring, Charlie revitalized the organization and created a blueprint for other communities to try to replicate. Charlie gets his motivation for helping his community from his time volunteering at his local food pantry and after-school program. As well as CT, Charlie founded two other organizations, KnightConnect and FinEdVenture, which impact students within his schoolâ€™s community and worldwide, respectively. In his spare time, Charlie enjoys playing soccer and lacrosse, hanging out with his friends and family, and spending time outside with his dogs. Charlie hopes to make a positive impact in his community by providing children with the education they not only need but deserve. </p>

            <p>David Min is a third-year at Yale College in New Haven, CT. He attended high school at Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, MA, and studied at the School for Ethics and Global Leadership in Washington, DC during the Fall of 2020. David founded BCT during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic after realizing that education is a critical aspect of oneâ€™s life that can promote social mobility and develop critical thinking skills. With the pandemic having exacerbated the economic and educational inequalities in his country, David wanted to give back to his community. Inspired by his own experiences with tutoring, David hopes that students will not only receive the educational experience they may need but also the opportunity to cultivate a lasting relationship with their tutor. In his spare time, he enjoys playing the oboe, writing for his school newspaper, and spending time with his family. </p>
